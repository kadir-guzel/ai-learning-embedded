# PyTorch Equivalent - Image Classification

This example shows the same image classification task as the FastAI example, but implemented in pure PyTorch. You'll see the difference in code complexity and control.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

- **Manual Training Loops** - Full control over training process
- **Custom Data Loading** - PyTorch DataLoaders and transforms
- **Model Architecture** - Building and modifying neural networks
- **Optimization Details** - Learning rates, schedulers, loss functions

## ðŸš€ Key PyTorch Advantages

1. **Full Control** - Every aspect is customizable
2. **Flexibility** - Easy to modify any component
3. **Production Ready** - Fine-grained optimization
4. **Research Friendly** - Implement cutting-edge techniques

## ðŸ“Š Performance Comparison

Compare this with the FastAI version:
- **Code Length**: ~150 lines vs ~10 lines
- **Training Time**: Similar performance
- **Customization**: Unlimited vs pre-defined options
- **Learning Curve**: Steeper vs gentle

This shows when PyTorch's complexity pays off!
