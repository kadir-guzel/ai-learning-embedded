# Model Quantization for Edge Deployment

This example demonstrates how to optimize neural networks for edge devices using quantization techniques. Critical for embedded systems with limited memory and compute.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

- **Post-Training Quantization** - Quick optimization without retraining
- **Quantization-Aware Training** - Better accuracy with training-time quantization
- **INT8 vs FP32** - Performance and accuracy trade-offs
- **Model Size Reduction** - From 32-bit to 8-bit representations

## ðŸš€ Why Quantization Matters for Embedded AI

1. **4x Smaller Models** - INT8 uses 1/4 the memory of FP32
2. **Faster Inference** - Integer operations are faster than floating point
3. **Lower Power** - Critical for battery-powered devices
4. **Hardware Acceleration** - Many edge chips optimize for INT8

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

- **Model Size**: 85MB â†’ 21MB (4x reduction)
- **Inference Speed**: 2-4x faster on edge hardware
- **Accuracy Loss**: <2% with proper calibration
- **Memory Usage**: 75% reduction
